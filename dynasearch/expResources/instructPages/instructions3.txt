In the following screens, you will see several different hurricane scenarios and judge the likelihood that a hurricane will make landfall in each of eight different sectors of the shoreline around the Gulf of Mexico.

<br/><br/>
	1. At the top right of each training page, you will see the number of the hurricane and its track direction. 
<br/><br/>
	2. Just below the text box are two tables showing the Impact Category and the Storm Category. The hurricane’s intensity is indicated by its Saffir-Simpson category and the wind speed corresponding to that category.
<br/><br/>
	3. At the right of the screen, you will find eight sectors listed in clockwise order beginning at North. After looking at the hurricane information tables and the tracking map, please click the DONE button and go to the next screen. On the next survey screen, you will find a question asking you for the probabilities. Please enter a number between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that you think the hurricane will strike each of those eight sectors.  
<br/><br/>
	4. All the hurricanes have the same location in the Gulf of Mexico, just north of the Yucatan Peninsula at Latitude 24° N, Longitude 89° W. The location of the hurricane eye is indicated by a small circle.
<br/><br/>
	5. All the hurricanes different in their current intensity (Saffir-Simpson category) and the track direction that has been forecast by the National Hurricane Center. The track direction is indicated by an arrow indicating the forecast track direction. 
<br/><br/>
	6. The simulate the occasional situation in which data communication from the National Hurricane Center has been interrupted, one of hurricane scenarios has only hurricane position information-there is no track or intensity information. Despite the limited information, you should make your best judgment about the probability of the hurricane making land fall in each of the eight sectors.
<br/><br/>
When you make your judgment of likelihood, please indicate the probability that the hurricane will HIT. A probability is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that an event is impossible and 1 indicates that it will definitely happen. Numbers between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of belief that the event could occur.
