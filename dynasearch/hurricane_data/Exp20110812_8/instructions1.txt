In this study, you will be asked to play the role of an emergency manager for a Texas coastal county. Your first duty will be to read The Official's Guide to Hurricane Evacuation. This Official's Guide is a revised version of a manual that the State of Texas gives to city and county officials so they can better understand hurricane behavior. The Official’s Guide explains how to track a hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico toward the Texas coast. It also suggests what information to consider in deciding whether to warn people in coastal counties to evacuate.

<br/><br/>
Your second duty will be to track a hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico. The tracking data is presented as a series of hurricane forecast advisories from the National Hurricane Center. Each forecast advisory contains important information about the hurricane's intensity, its likelihood of striking different coastal communities, and the time needed to evacuate your county. Each forecast advisory also contains a hurricane tracking map that shows where the hurricane has been, where it is forecast to go, and how uncertain the forecast is. 
<br/><br/>
Your third duty will be to provide a situational assessment for your County Judge after each forecast advisory. This situational assessment has been standardized to allow you to generate a threat profile by indicating your assessment of the likelihood of a number of different outcomes for your jurisdiction. You will also need to answer some questions from the County Judge about the information you have seen in the forecast advisory. Some of these questions might not have had the answers displayed on the screen; in some cases, you may need to provide the County Judge with an estimate based on the information you have seen.
<br/><br/>
Finally, at the end of the hurricane tracking task, you will need to provide a debriefing about the task and also answer some questions about yourself.
